# Contributing

If you have any questions about [YOURLS API](https://github.com/neocotic/yourls-api) please feel free to
[raise an issue](https://github.com/neocotic/yourls-api/issues/new).

Please [search existing issues](https://github.com/neocotic/yourls-api/issues) for the same feature and/or issue before
raising a new issue. Commenting on an existing issue is usually preferred over raising duplicate issues.

Please ensure that all files conform to the coding standards, using the same coding style as the rest of the code base,
and that you add/update any relevant unit tests (found in the `test` directory) and ensure that all tests are currently
passing. This can be done easily via command-line:

``` bash
# install/update package dependencies
$ npm install
# run test suite
$ npm test
```

This will recompile the distribution files as well.

If you're using a version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) that is older than 0.12, then linting is not performed by
this step. Please consider upgrading to at least 0.12 or your pull request may fail on the CI build.

Likewise, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) versions older than 0.10 will also not be able to compile the source code using
[Rollup](http://rollupjs.org) so the test suite will not be executed against any changes you've made to `src/**.js`. For
this reason, 0.10 is not supported from a development perspective, but our CI builds do run the test suite against the
pre-compiled code for this version to ensure that it works.

All pull requests should be made to the `develop` branch.

Don't forget to add your details to the list of
[AUTHORS.md](https://github.com/neocotic/yourls-api/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) if you want your contribution to be
recognized by others.
